<h1>Software Used</h1>

<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>Operators in C++ are symbols that perform specific operations on variables and values. They include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==, !=, >, <), logical operators (&&, ||, !), bitwise operators (&, |, ^), and assignment operators (=, +=, -=), among others.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this experiment helped us understand about operators in c++. We have used that knowledge to write coddes that check if a number is positive, find the quadrant after taking coordinates as input, grading system which displays grade after taking marks of 5 subjects as input, reverse last five digits of PRN.</p>
